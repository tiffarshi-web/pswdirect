      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Assess care needs:</strong> Determine the level of support required — personal care, companionship, or specialized services like hospital discharge assistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Decide on hours:</strong> Will you need daily, weekly, or occasional visits? PSW Direct offers flexible hourly bookings with no contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify credentials:</strong> Ensure the PSW has completed an accredited PSW program and holds a valid police check. PSW Direct verifies all credentials before approving caregivers.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask the right questions:</strong> Inquire about experience with specific conditions, availability, language abilities, and comfort with pets or mobility equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Book a trial visit:</strong> Start with a short booking to evaluate compatibility before committing to ongoing care.</li>
      </ol>
