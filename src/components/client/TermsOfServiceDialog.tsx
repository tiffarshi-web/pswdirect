END-USER TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT
PSW DIRECT INC.
Ontario, Canada

IMPORTANT — PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OUR SERVICES

This End-User Terms of Service Agreement ("Agreement") is a legally binding contract between you ("User," "you," or "your") and PSW Direct Inc. ("PSW Direct," "Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our platform, applications, or services (collectively, the "Platform"), you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to comply with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

If you do not agree with any part of this Agreement, you must not access or use the Platform.

1. ROLE AND NATURE OF PSW DIRECT INC.

1.1 PSW Direct is a technology-based platform that facilitates connections between independent Personal Support Workers ("PSWs") and Users (individuals or their legal representatives) who are seeking in-home assistance or related services.

1.2 PSW Direct is NOT a licensed healthcare provider, staffing agency, or home care agency. It does not employ, supervise, direct, or control any PSW. All PSWs who utilize the Platform are independent contractors and are solely responsible for the services they provide.

1.3 PSW Direct does NOT provide medical, nursing, or therapeutic services. It does NOT diagnose, treat, or manage any medical condition.

2. NO HEALTHCARE, MEDICAL, OR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

2.1 PSW Direct does NOT provide or arrange for any form of healthcare, medical services, nursing care, or professional therapeutic interventions.

2.2 Any care coordinated through the Platform is strictly limited to non-clinical, personal support tasks, such as assistance with activities of daily living, companionship, light housekeeping, or meal preparation.

2.3 Users acknowledge that PSW Direct and the PSWs accessible through the Platform are NOT qualified to:
• Diagnose or treat illnesses or medical conditions
• Provide medical advice, recommendations, or opinions
• Administer medications
• Monitor or interpret clinical data
• Perform any clinical, regulated, or invasive health procedures
• Provide nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, or other health services

2.4 For any medical, nursing, or clinical care needs, Users must consult qualified, licensed healthcare professionals directly. PSW Direct disclaims any responsibility for health-related decisions made by Users.

3. USER ELIGIBILITY AND ACCOUNT RESPONSIBILITY

3.1 Users must be at least eighteen (18) years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement.

3.2 If the User is acting as a substitute decision-maker (e.g., Power of Attorney for Personal Care) on behalf of another individual, the User represents and warrants that they have the legal authority to do so.

3.3 Users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials and for all activities conducted under their account.

4. USER RESPONSIBILITIES AND REQUIRED DISCLOSURES

4.1 Users must disclose, at the time of booking, any known information that is relevant to ensuring the PSW's safety and the appropriateness of the match, including but not limited to:
• Mobility limitations or physical disabilities
• Cognitive impairments (e.g., dementia, Alzheimer's disease)
• Behavioural challenges or tendencies (e.g., aggression, wandering)
• Infectious diseases or communicable conditions
• Environmental hazards in the home (e.g., pests, pets, structural risks)
• Requirements for lifting, transferring, or physical support

4.2 Failure to disclose material information may result in immediate termination of the service, suspension from the Platform, and potential liability for any injuries or damages incurred.

4.3 Users agree to treat all PSWs with respect and dignity. Any form of harassment, abuse, discrimination, or inappropriate conduct toward PSWs is strictly prohibited and may result in account suspension or termination.

5. ONTARIO-SPECIFIC REGULATORY DISCLOSURES

5.1 PSW Direct Inc. is registered and operates exclusively in Ontario, Canada. Users and PSWs accessing the Platform agree that services are provided and received within Ontario and are subject to Ontario law.

5.2 PSW Direct is NOT a licensed home care agency under the Home Care and Community Services Act, 1994 (Ontario), nor is it regulated under the Fixing Long-Term Care Act, 2021, or any successor legislation. It is a technology platform only.

5.3 Personal Support Workers who use the Platform are NOT employees of PSW Direct. Each PSW is an independent contractor who is responsible for:
• Their own qualifications, credentials, and certifications
• Maintaining appropriate personal liability insurance
• Paying their own taxes
• Complying with applicable laws and professional standards

5.4 PSW Direct does NOT guarantee that PSWs have any specific training, certification, or qualifications, including but not limited to:
• Ontario PSW certification from an accredited educational institution

• Police Vulnerable Sector Check clearance
• Training for specialized care (e.g., dementia care, palliative care)

5.5 Users are solely responsible for independently verifying any PSW's qualifications, credentials, insurance coverage, and suitability before accepting their services. PSW Direct is not liable for any misrepresentations or omissions by a PSW regarding their qualifications.

6. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN USER AND PERSONAL SUPPORT WORKER

6.1 PSW Direct functions solely as an intermediary. It facilitates the connection between Users and PSWs but is NOT a party to any agreement, arrangement, or contract for services that may arise between a User and a PSW.

6.2 All service agreements, schedules, rates, and terms are negotiated directly between Users and PSWs through the Platform. PSW Direct does NOT dictate, supervise, or control the terms of those arrangements.

6.3 All responsibility for the quality, adequacy, safety, and legality of services rests solely with the PSW who provides them.

7. FEES, PAYMENTS, AND PLATFORM CHARGES

7.1 Users agree to pay all applicable fees as disclosed at the time of booking. Fees may include:
• Service fees charged by PSWs
• Platform facilitation or booking fees
• Cancellation or late-change fees
• Any applicable taxes (e.g., HST)

7.2 All payments are processed securely through third-party payment providers (e.g., Stripe). PSW Direct is not responsible for payment processing errors caused by third-party services.

7.3 Refunds, if any, are subject to PSW Direct's Refund and Cancellation Policy, which may be updated from time to time at the Company's sole discretion.
