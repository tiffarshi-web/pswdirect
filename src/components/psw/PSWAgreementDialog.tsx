INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND PLATFORM ACCESS AGREEMENT

IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE – ELECTRONIC ACCEPTANCE

This Independent Contractor and Platform Access Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legally binding contract between you and PSW Direct Inc. governing your access to and use of the PSW Direct website, any web-based application, and any future mobile application or related technology (collectively, the "Platform").

By clicking "I Agree," "Accept," "Continue," or by otherwise accessing or using the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that you have carefully read and understood this Agreement in its entirety, that you are entering into this Agreement voluntarily and electronically, that this Agreement has the same legal effect as a signed written contract, and that no employment relationship exists between you and PSW Direct Inc.

If you do not agree to all terms of this Agreement, you must not access or use the Platform.

1. ROLE AND NATURE OF PSW DIRECT INC.

PSW Direct Inc. is a technology company that operates an online marketplace designed to facilitate introductions and communications between independent personal support workers and individuals or organizations seeking personal support services. The Platform functions solely as a digital intermediary that enables contractors to identify potential service opportunities and enables clients to identify potential service providers.

PSW Direct Inc. does not provide personal support services, healthcare services, nursing services, home-care services, or any hands-on services of any kind. PSW Direct Inc. does not supervise, manage, train, direct, control, or evaluate the manner in which contractors perform services, nor does it determine the methods, timing, tools, equipment, or professional judgment used by contractors in the performance of services.

All services offered, accepted, and performed through the Platform are provided exclusively by the contractor, acting independently and directly for the client. PSW Direct Inc. expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability for the quality, safety, legality, appropriateness, or outcome of services performed by contractors.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary, or representative relationship between PSW Direct Inc. and any contractor.

2. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS

You expressly acknowledge, confirm, and agree that you are engaged as an independent contractor and not as an employee of PSW Direct Inc. You acknowledge that you are operating an independent caregiving or support services business and that you retain full control over whether, when, where, and how you perform services.

You further acknowledge that you are not entitled to, and expressly waive any claim to, employment-related rights, benefits, or protections, including employment insurance, Canada Pension Plan contributions by PSW Direct Inc., workers' compensation coverage, minimum wage protections, overtime pay, vacation pay, statutory holiday pay, paid sick leave, notice of termination, or any other benefit or protection arising under employment or labour legislation.

Nothing in this Agreement, nor your use of the Platform, shall be interpreted as creating an employment relationship, and you agree not to assert otherwise in any legal, administrative, or regulatory proceeding.

3. TAXES, REMITTANCES, AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for determining, reporting, and remitting all taxes, levies, contributions, and assessments arising from amounts paid to you through the Platform, including income taxes, GST or HST if applicable, Canada Pension Plan contributions, and any other federal, provincial, or municipal obligations.

PSW Direct Inc. does not withhold, deduct, or remit taxes or contributions on your behalf unless expressly required by law, and you agree to indemnify and hold PSW Direct Inc. harmless from any claims, penalties, interest, or assessments arising from your failure to comply with tax or remittance obligations.

4. ELIGIBILITY, QUALIFICATIONS, AND CONTINUING DISCLOSURE

By accepting this Agreement, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you are legally entitled to work in Canada, are at least eighteen years of age, and possess the education, training, skills, experience, and judgment necessary to safely and competently provide personal support services.

You further represent that all information you have provided to PSW Direct Inc., including information relating to your identity, background, training, and experience, is true, accurate, and complete.

You agree that you have an ongoing obligation to promptly disclose to PSW Direct Inc. any change in circumstances that may affect your eligibility or suitability to provide services, including the expiration or loss of relevant training, criminal charges or convictions related to safety or trust, regulatory investigations, or any physical or mental condition that may impair your ability to safely perform services.

PSW Direct Inc. reserves the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or deactivate your access to the Platform based on such disclosures or failures to disclose or for any other reason in its sole discretion.

5. PERSONAL SUPPORT WORKER

You acknowledge and agree that, in the Province of Ontario, personal support workers are not a regulated health profession and are not governed by a professional college under the Regulated Health Professions Act.

You expressly acknowledge that you are not authorized to perform controlled acts under Ontario law, including diagnosing conditions, prescribing medications, or performing medical or nursing procedures, unless otherwise lawfully permitted.

You agree that you will not represent yourself as a nurse, healthcare professional, or regulated health practitioner, and that you are solely responsible for ensuring that all services you provide remain within the lawful scope of personal support services.

PSW Direct Inc. does not verify, certify, or guarantee your compliance with applicable scope-of-practice requirements and expressly disclaims responsibility for any services performed outside lawful scope.

6. PLATFORM ACCESS AND LICENSE

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, PSW Direct Inc. grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Platform solely for the purpose of identifying and accepting service opportunities.

You agree not to misuse the Platform, including copying, scraping, reverse engineering, or exploiting any portion of the Platform, circumventing payment or fee mechanisms, soliciting clients outside the Platform to avoid fees, sharing access credentials, or using the Platform for unlawful, deceptive, or unsafe purposes.

PSW Direct Inc. may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform at any time, with or without notice, where it determines, in its sole discretion, that continued access poses legal, safety, regulatory, or reputational risk.

7. ACCEPTANCE, PERFORMANCE, AND CANCELLATION OF ASSIGNMENTS

You acknowledge that you are under no obligation to accept any service request and retain complete discretion over whether to accept or decline opportunities presented through the Platform.

Once you accept a service request, you agree to perform the services in a professional, competent, and respectful manner, consistent with industry standards, lawful client instructions, and applicable safety considerations.

Cancellations made within four hours of a scheduled assignment may result in a cancellation fee which is currently $25 (subject to change), which you expressly authorize PSW Direct Inc. to deduct from future payments.

8. PAYMENTS, FEES, AND DEDUCTIONS

You acknowledge that rates for services may be set or accepted through the Platform and that PSW Direct Inc. may charge platform, service, or administrative fees in connection with facilitating transactions.

You expressly authorize PSW Direct Inc. to deduct applicable fees, cancellation charges, chargebacks, dispute adjustments, or other amounts permitted under Platform policies.

Payments are processed electronically and may be delayed, adjusted, or withheld in connection with fraud prevention, dispute resolution, or compliance reviews.

9. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND CLIENT SAFETY

You agree to conduct yourself in a manner that prioritizes client safety, dignity, and privacy. You shall not abuse, neglect, exploit, harass, or discriminate against any client, nor shall you engage in inappropriate personal, financial, or emotional relationships with clients.

You shall not handle client finances, accept gifts or inheritances, provide legal or medical advice, or otherwise exceed the lawful scope of personal support services.

10. INSURANCE

You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining, at your own expense, any insurance coverage you deem necessary or appropriate, including commercial general liability insurance, professional liability insurance, and health or disability insurance.

PSW Direct Inc. does not provide insurance coverage of any kind and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.

11. ASSUMPTION OF RISK

You acknowledge that providing personal support services involves inherent risks, including risks of physical injury, illness, exposure to communicable diseases, unsafe environments, and unpredictable client or third-party conduct.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you knowingly and voluntarily assume all such risks and agree that PSW Direct Inc. shall not be responsible for any resulting injury, loss, or damage.

12. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to fully defend, indemnify, and hold harmless PSW Direct Inc., its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, penalties, fines, regulatory actions, and legal costs arising out of or related to your services, your conduct, your breach of this Agreement, or any injury, harm, or death suffered by a client or third party.

13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

To the maximum extent permitted by law, PSW Direct Inc. shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. In no event shall PSW Direct Inc.'s total liability exceed the lesser of one hundred dollars Canadian or the total platform fees paid to PSW Direct Inc. in the twelve months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

14. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY

You agree to maintain the confidentiality of client information and Platform data and to comply with all applicable privacy legislation, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.

15. NON-CIRCUMVENTION AND NON-SOLICITATION
